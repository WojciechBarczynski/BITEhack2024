# BITEhack2024 - Quit It

Welcome to **Quit It**! - an innovative social-media platform designed to support individuals in overcoming their habits with the help of friends. Unique features that seamlessly integrate community support and the proximity of your closest provide an effective platform for both you and your friends to conquer habits together.

## Introduction

Supporting individuals in overcoming addiction plays a [crucial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3917180/pdf/IJNMR-19-19.pdf) role in their success on the challenging journey toward health and regaining control over their lives. Being open, empathetic, and providing support can expedite the recovery process, helping individuals conquer the challenges associated with addiction. Support not only builds strong social bonds but also inspires positive changes, creating an atmosphere where every step towards health is acknowledged and encouraged.

In the event of breaking the streak of addiction-free days, the application promptly notifies the user of this occurrence. Additionally, it provides specific information regarding potential risks associated with reverting to the addiction. For example, in the case of smoking cigarettes, the app may highlight the increased risk of developing lung cancer based on [research on Oxford](https://watermark.silverchair.com/zv800204000099.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAA1QwggNQBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggNBMIIDPQIBADCCAzYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM5lxTpp-hwvt6m-lYAgEQgIIDBy1IVgpXc-v6dZ6PC-7_eOKGh1dWkCDlGpS2QP8YNpjgidj2KggUs8v-5YAYOkxHrURv_hjv6_QIiFV9gn9KlxKf_f16EvU3GqMAcH2DPFlmsIUe0sMc3seNAF_ckyWqE4ELIe9tt0QUicQ2fm5iwNe0ynnbsMukD2BM16UNtc4dPjkHHnaEFAEORPaSBYcX2lHbax_PBhlUNz7EUEZtWmZ_aIwVqhAiGsTZurwZL9RuEAIxiE_mvSbm2Jc8GBpLal3GjkrRLMn0EIvUtRDqCqh4uW1pb8-lLj9skn8_cNjaXDFStpHrC141sr579gsUszPK2SnXg9_5vj9d57q4SNrCczKo_F_8wQybbnNOble_7DeWqnII8qYKa2gbD6rFI_Ail15ehx8NiXUNIaavbU1KoGwo66l6P0B3SKWoBCGBcHyNjGrizisiol3XEGNmVUuCRtt3n5ES08BRV1C9dpevw8ABoyw6UIUQNuTC9nqs0q5aRqvxLoOMTg38knv4U8SS04aTV9er3X9_xj9mCByy0xaUOmeo1-sqCCnf4FW2So5ASB0McrJ7nM4Fq-AiMA0aS07RULAAHBZLV06BX5m_L_Bpjo9x2ShvsVwchvgZk5XPXHUOuX88QXOPUOwkXPdVbjYjiF8N4khSe2Yv2ZncSm5-c0M2rZCLoOaQDMmhA8q5idC6Q9EuX_n5sm340_ZE2yDnTa6gvHtnkKM-CAxMQmYZlofzVUKJHA5h4nY--W00TYtbiCZ_Nmv0c76rUF757BQHENdRZZmjyEE94VXZndVunRjCx0NuA9EcKJGP-LmhC_L6ZOBUktXJVRvE86_hOidDU_caCkcHuKQOrTGt6S_jVpn6PQ08rNz_gL3tcE9qKaVXMlwoWqtjCu2ZSVUQiEpHme3Q24-2Bdyk2aKg4wyE0HovX_tMWcyN8kuFVRyWgLS57Sw6k73w1JhlIrSOgKMR1J2QcQLU_lbiyoqImQOEj_jFIBPwpsZSEbNiPrFuSTJtnNkUS0fh0gyhyKpIH9ICobE) and some other articles.
